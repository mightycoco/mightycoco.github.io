<title>(ALXING)</title>

<purpose>
    <p>ALXING is a 10hp motif generator creating a sequence of quantized CV values. The output can be clamped to a
        specific scale and the density of available notes can be reduced via the density parameter.</p>
</purpose>

    <p>
        The term for it is "Constrained Random CV Generator", but one can think of it as a Turing Machine on steroids.
        It's designed to have good performance capabilities and also to bring additional functions with it, easing the
        usage.
    </p>

    <p>
        The quantiser for example makes it a lot more convenient to work with it melodically and the plethora of scales
        let it spit out fresh tunes every time.
        Also a clock with selectable subdivisions or different playmodes are build in to spice up the musical figures
        just discovered, only to name a few.
    </p>

    <p>
        Secondly the preset save and recall option comes in handy if one likes to go back to known places within the
        composition or use it to build a song like structure using saved sequences.</p>
    </p>

    <p>
        Talking about Modulation.
        Alxing implements cv-able main parameters and a freely routable MOD in- or output to interact with it's
        compounds
        even more deeply.
        Don't miss out on this package of endless fun, steering through happy accidents and a landscape of motifs to
        reveal.
